# Climate Claims: Finding the Facts in a "Post-Truth" World

##### Article Analysis
*Shafting the Poor*, written by Willis Eschenbach, explores the impact of increased energy prices (Eschenbach, 2021). Eschenbach first notes the lower consumer prices of gasoline and electricity in the USA compared to ten European countries. He then states that the lowest-income bracket in the USA spends around 22% of their income on energy while the highest-income bracket spends around 5% of their income (Eschenbach, 2021). Eschenbach then claims that this global disparity leads to energy poverty, which is characterized by an inability to afford basic energy costs, such as heating and transportation. He describes this phenomenon in Europe, claiming that over 30 million Europeans are unable to afford adequate heating during the winter (Eschenbach, 2021). He remarks that the USA had one of the largest decreases in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita in the 2010s, suggesting that increased energy prices are not placing European countries at an advantage in reducing emissions (Eschenbach, 2021). Eschenbach therefore concludes that increased energy prices hurt the poor and do not benefit CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions.   

One reason this article was interesting to me is because I am unfamiliar with discussions on the economic cost of climate measures compared to their future benefits. I was intrigued by this article describing effects on the general public. I was also attracted to this article by the amount of quantitative information it uses in its arguments, which initially appear to support the article.   

The author of this article, Willis Eschenbach, was the CFO for South Pacific Oil from 2007-2010 (Eschenbach, 2016). His education does not reflect a scientific background, but he has published a couple articles in peer-reviewed journals such as Nature. The article itself is not peer-reviewed and is published on a website called Watts Up With That, which promotes ideas supporting climate change denial and is a prominent source of  pseudo-science (Van Zandt, 2021). References to corroborate the article’s findings are mostly missing. The article was published less than two weeks ago, and appears to use recent data. Overall, while the article is recent, it does not have references to support its information and it loses credibility because the website and author contain a lot of bias and lack credentials.  

The article contains graphs comparing gasoline and electricity prices in the USA compared to Europe (see Figure 1). While the graphs do not include a year and are unreferenced, the values are similar to current numbers (Randall, McIntyre and Diamond, 2020) (Sonnichsen, 2020). However, the USA ranks higher than many European countries in percentage of income spent on gasoline prices, demonstrating the importance of economic context in these issues (Randall, McIntyre and Diamond, 2020) . The article also displays CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction per capita matching real values (CO<sub>2</sub>  emissions (metric tons per capita), 2021). However, the USA has one of the largest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita compared to European countries, making emission reduction between these countries difficult to compare.

**Figure 1: A comparison of gasoline and electricity prices in several European countries compared to the USA (Eschenbach, 2021). The author of this article uses these graphs to demonstrate high energy prices in Europe compared to the USA, which is fueling energy poverty. The source of this information is unclear, but the values are similar to current values. However, it is important to consider the economic context of each country when comparing energy prices and their impact on energy poverty.** 

The article highlights energy poverty by referencing a report from the Jacques Delors Institute (Magdalinski, Delair and Pellerin-Carlin, 2021). The Jacques Delors Institute is a think tank run by past government leaders, and the writers of this report have an educational background in climate research, providing a degree of validity. Their results are echoed in other scientific studies and reports that acknowledge the importance of energy poverty (González-Eguino, 2015). However, energy poverty is a complex issue not singularly attributable or even correlated with energy price (Bollino and Botti, 2017). Overall, the article’s information is accurate and relates to relevant issues, but the conclusions are unjustified and ignore the complexity of the issues.
