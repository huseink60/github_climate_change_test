# Climate Claims: Finding the Facts in a "Post-Truth" World 
### Khalil Husein, February 14, 2021, ISCI 3A12

##### Article List
1. *The Economics of Wind Power in Future - Blindness and Insight*
* [Offshore Wind-High Risk | Friends of Science Calgary](https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2020/09/30/the-economics-of-wind-power-in-future-blindness-and-insight/) 
* This article claims that the economic cost of wind power outweighs and will continue to outweigh revenue and energy output, making wind power a financially unfeasible energy source.
* The article appears to use a valid source and the writing style is relatively professional, while catering towards those unfamiliar with the topic such as myself.
2. *Four Decades of Island Area Change Across Tuvalu*
* [Tuvalu Land Area | CO2 Science](http://www.co2science.org/articles/V23/dec/a7.php)
* This article claims that the threat of rising sea levels has been exaggerated, pointing out the island of Tuvalu, where there has been a net increase in area in the past four decades.
* Their argument is based on an article published by Nature that, while partially misconstrued by the authors of this article, does state that land area has increased in Tuvalu, suggesting that there are other important external processes to consider when studying the effects of climate change. 
3. *Effects of Elevated CO2 on the Development and Fecundity of an Aphid Pest*
* [Aphid Pest | CO2 Science](http://www.co2science.org/articles/V24/feb/a3.php)
* This article claims that elevated CO2 levels can be beneficial in wheat growth and is helpful in managing pests such as the bird cherry-oat aphid by impeding their development and reducing their fertility.
* This article cites a peer-reviewed scientific article and acts as a reminder of the complicated effects of climate change, including some perceived positive effects.
